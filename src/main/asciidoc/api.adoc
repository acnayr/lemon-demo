= Spring Lemon Demo API Reference
Spring Lemon version 0.12
:toc: right

== Introduction

This is the API documentation of https://github.com/naturalprogrammer/lemon-demo[Spring Lemon Demo application]. This API can be called from browser based front-ends (e.g. AngularJS single page applications), as well as non-browser clients.

NOTE: Please note that here we won't cover the common things e.g. passing CSRF token or JSESSION id. Go through https://naturalprogrammer.gitbooks.io/spring-lemon-getting-started/content/api_documentation.html[this page] for those details.

== Ping

Sends a GET request to the server. This is useful for fetching the CSRF cookie after an event that would have changed the CSRF token, e.g. _logout_. See https://naturalprogrammer.gitbooks.io/spring-lemon-getting-started/content/api_documentation.html#csrf[here] for more details.

In summary, you may need to call this before any request that results in _CSRF mismatch_ error.

=== Request

include::{snippets}/ping/http-request.adoc[]

=== Response

include::{snippets}/ping/http-response.adoc[]

Notice how we get the CSRF cookie in the response, which is to be sent as a header in next requests. Read https://naturalprogrammer.gitbooks.io/spring-lemon-getting-started/content/api_documentation.html#csrf[this] for more details.

=== Business rules

. Should return a 200 OK with a cookie named "XSRF-TOKEN"

=== Positive test cases

. Should return a 200 OK with a cookie named "XSRF-TOKEN"

== Get context

Gets useful application properties and current user data.

TIP: Call this to fetch useful application properties and current-user data when an AngularJS application starts.

=== Request

include::{snippets}/context/http-request.adoc[]

=== Response

include::{snippets}/context/http-response.adoc[]

*Fields*

include::{snippets}/context/response-fields.adoc[]

_user_ would be omitted if nobody is logged in.

Refer the book https://gum.co/exuo/associate[Spring Framework REST API Development - A Complete Blueprint] to know how to customize this response and other details.

=== Business rules

The _current-user_ data, _reCaptchaSiteKey_, and the _lemon.shared.*_ properties should be there in the response. Current-user data shouldn't include any confidential fields.

=== Positive test cases

. When not logged in, _reCaptchaSiteKey_, _lemon.shared.*_ properties should be there in the response. Current user data should be absent.
. When logged in, _reCaptchaSiteKey_, _lemon.shared.*_ properties should be there in the response. Current user data should look as above, with confidential fields omitted..

== Login

Logs the user in. To remember the user for 15 days, send a _rememberMe_ parameter set as `true`.

=== Request

include::{snippets}/login/http-request.adoc[]

*Parameters*

include::{snippets}/login/request-parameters.adoc[]

=== Response

include::{snippets}/login/http-response.adoc[]

=== Business rules

. Upon successful login, current-user data should be returned as the response.
. Giving wrong credentials should respond with `401 Aunauthorized`.
. Spring security token based http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#remember-me[remember-me] rules apply. Importantly,
.. A `rememberMe` cookie is returned when `rememberMe=true` is passed as a request parameter.
.. Sending the remember me cookie from a different session within 15 days would log the user in.
.. Upon logout, the cookie is reset.

=== Positive test cases

. When a good ADMIN logs in, the response should contain
.. his `name`
.. a `roles` collection with role "ADMIN"
.. `goodAdmin` as true
. When `rememberMe=true` parameter is sent, a `rememberMe` cookie is received. That cookie can be used in a different session to log the user in. Upon logging out from that session, the `rememberMe` cookie is reset.

=== Negative test cases

. Giving wrong credentials should respond with `401 Aunauthorized`.
. A wrong `rememberMe` cookie should not log a user in.

== Logout

Logs a user out.

=== Request

include::{snippets}/logout/http-request.adoc[]

=== Response

=== Request

include::{snippets}/signup/http-request.adoc[]

*Add `captchaResponse` field if you want captcha validation*. Sign up let's you use the new https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/[reCAPTCHA] from Google. If you use it, `captchaResponse` field should hold the captcha response. To use it,

. At the server side, set a couple of properties, as described https://naturalprogrammer.gitbooks.io/spring-lemon-getting-started/content/configuring/setting-up-application-properties.html[here].
. At the client side, for an AngularJS client, https://github.com/VividCortex/angular-recaptcha[angular-recaptcha] works great. Remember to send the captcha response in the `captchaResponse` field.

If you don't want Captcha, e.g. in a demo app, just don't provide the captcha related properties in _application.yml_.

=== Response

include::{snippets}/signup/http-response.adoc[]

=== Business rules

. Nobody should have already logged in.
. Email, password and name should be https://naturalprogrammer.gitbooks.io/spring-lemon-getting-started/content/common/user_constraints.html[valid].
. The role UNVERIFIED is added to the user upon sign up.
. Password is stored encoded.
. After successful sign up
.. The user is signed in.
.. A verification mail is sent to the given email id.

=== Positive test cases

. A user should be able to sign up.
. After signing up
.. The user should have signed in.
.. His role should be UNVERIFIED.
.. A verification mail should have been sent to the user.

=== Negative test cases

Sign up will respond with errors if you try it

. After being already logged in.
. With https://naturalprogrammer.gitbooks.io/spring-lemon-getting-started/content/common/user_constraints.html[invalid] email, password or name.
. Using an email id which is already signed up.
. With invalid captcha.

== Resend verification mail

A verification mail is sent to users upon sign up. But, sometimes they may miss it. So, when a unverified user signs in, you may like to show him a button or something to resend the verification mail. Clicking on that should send a request to your API as below.

=== Request

include::{snippets}/resend-verification-mail/http-request.adoc[]

=== Response

include::{snippets}/resend-verification-mail/http-response.adoc[]

=== Business rules

. The user should exist.
. Current-user should have https://naturalprogrammer.gitbooks.io/spring-lemon-getting-started/content/common/accessing_users.html[permission to edit] the given user.
. The user should not have been verified.
. A new verification code isn't generated. The existing verification code is used instead. It's because sometimes the user might find the old mail, and try verifying with that.

=== Test cases

*Positive*

. An unverified user should be able to resend his verification code. The verificationCode of the user should not change in the process.
. A good ADMIN should be able to resend the verification mail of another unverified user.

*Negative*

. Providing unknown user id
. Trying
.. without logging in
.. logging in as a different user
.. logging in as a bad ADMIN
.. while already verified



[[VerificationMail, verification mail]]
== Verify user

After a user signs up, he receives a verification mail. The mail contains a link with an embedded `verificationCode`. Clicking on it takes the user to the front-end application, where he is first asked to login if he is not already, and then click a _verify_ button. On clicking verify, a POST request is sent as below.

=== Request

include::{snippets}/verify-user/http-request.adoc[]

*Path parameters*

include::{snippets}/verify-user/path-parameters.adoc[]

=== Response

include::{snippets}/verify-user/http-response.adoc[]

=== Business rules

. The user must have logged in.
. The user must not have already verified.
. Verification code shouldn't be blank.
. Verification code should match the code that was mailed to the user while signing up.
. Upon successful verification, the UNVERIFIED role of the user is removed, and the verification code that was stored in the user record is wiped out.
. Upon successful commit, security principal's UNVERIFIED role is removed, and it's flags such as goodUser are computed again.
. Updated current-user data is returned.

=== Positive test cases

. A new user should be able to sign in, get a verification mail, and verify himself. Check that after verification,
.. The same user is returned in the response.
.. His UNVERIFIED role is removed.
.. His verificationCode is set as null.
.. Current-user, which is the user himself, has the following changes:
.. UNVERIFIED role is removed
.. He is now a good user

=== Negative test cases

. Re-verifying after successful verification.
. Trying with wrong verification code.
. Trying without logging the user in.

[[ForgotPassword]]
== Forgot Password

When a user forgets his password, he can post a form as below.

=== Request

include::{snippets}/forgot-password/http-request.adoc[]

It would create a secret `forgotPasswordCode`, and mail the user a link including that code, looking like https://your-front-end.com/users/{forgotPasswordCode}/reset-password.

Clicking on the link should allow the user to <<reset_his_password>>.

=== Response

include::{snippets}/forgot-password/http-response.adoc[]

. Not having a user with the given email address.

[[reset_his_password, reset his password]]
== Reset password

In the <<ForgotPassword>> section, we saw how a user gets a link with a `forgotPasswordCode`. Clicking on the link should take him to a front-end form, where he should enter a new password. Upon submitting that form, a request as below should be sent.

=== Request

include::{snippets}/reset-password/http-request.adoc[]

=== Response

=== Request

include::{snippets}/update-user/http-request.adoc[]

If you have added more updatable fields to User, they can also be updated using this request.

*What is version*

User, like all https://github.com/naturalprogrammer/spring-lemon/blob/master/src/main/java/com/naturalprogrammer/spring/lemon/domain/VersionedEntity.java[VersionedEntity], has a `version` column, which is incremented on each update.

While updating, it is first checked that the given version is equal to the version in the database record. Otherwise, it is assumed that someone else has updated the record concurrently, and the update fails. To use it, you will typically

. Along with the data to be updated, fetch the version column as well.
. When the user submits the updated data, send the version back along with the updated data.

Precisely, we are talking about optimistic locking. The book https://gum.co/exuo/associate[Spring Framework REST API Development - A Complete Blueprint] covers it in more details.

=== Response

Please note that the response is the data of the logged-in user, who isn't necessarily the updated one.

=== Business rules

. A user with the given `id` should exist.
. Current-user should have https://naturalprogrammer.gitbooks.io/spring-lemon-getting-started/content/common/accessing_users.html[permission to edit] the given user.
. `roles` will be updated only if the current-user has `permission to edit` the roles.
.. If UNVERIFIED role is removed from a user, his `verificationCode` should be set to null.
.. If UNVERIFIED role is added to a user, a `verificationCode` should also be generated, and a verification mail should be sent to the user.
. The new name https://naturalprogrammer.gitbooks.io/spring-lemon-getting-started/content/common/user_constraints.html[should be valid].
. The version column should be incremented on successful update.
. The user shouldn't have been already updated concurrently, i.e. the input `version` should match the version in the database. Otherwise, expect a `409` response.
. If a user is updating himself, upon successful commit, the Security principal object is updated with the new name.

== Positive test cases

. A non-admin user should be able to update his own name, but changes in roles should be skipped. The name of security principal object should also change in the process. The version column should be updated.
. A good ADMIN should be able to update another user's name and roles. Check that the name of security principal object should NOT change in the process by mistake.
.. When making a user UNVERIFIED, a verificationCode should be generated.
.. When making a user verified, the verificationCode should be set to null.

=== Negative test cases

`oldPassword` should match the user's existing password.
. `password` and `retypePassword` should be same. (Ideally, this validation could have been left to the front-end. But, we thought to make this a server feature, for exibihiting how to code form-level custom validation.)
. If a user is changing his own password, after successful commit, he should be logged out.

=== Positive test cases

A user (or a good ADMIN) can request for changing email id, by using the following request.

=== Request

include::{snippets}/request-email-change/http-request.adoc[]

On receiving such a request, an email containing a link is sent to the new email id. A secret `changeEmailCode` is embedded in the link. Clicking on the link brings the user back to the front-end, where first he should log in if he is not already. Then, he would click a button for sending the <<final-change-email-request>> for doing the final change.

== Change email

When a user <<request-for-changing-email>>, a mail is sent to him, which contains a link with a `changeEmailCode` embedded. Clicking on the link brings him back to the client, where first he should login if he is not already. He then would click a button for proceeding with the change, which will send the following request to the server.
