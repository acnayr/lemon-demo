= Spring Lemon Demo API Reference
Spring Lemon version 0.12
:toc: right

== Introduction

This is the API documentation of https://github.com/naturalprogrammer/lemon-demo[Spring Lemon Demo application]. This API can be called from browser based front-ends (e.g. AngularJS single page applications), as well as non-browser clients.

NOTE: Please note that here we won't cover the common things e.g. passing CSRF token or JSESSION id. Go through https://naturalprogrammer.gitbooks.io/spring-lemon-getting-started/content/api_documentation.html[this page] for those details.

== Ping

Sends a GET request to the server. This is useful for fetching the CSRF cookie after an event that would have changed the CSRF token, e.g. _logout_. See https://naturalprogrammer.gitbooks.io/spring-lemon-getting-started/content/api_documentation.html#csrf[here] for more details.

In summary, you may need to call this before any request that results in _CSRF mismatch_ error.

=== Request

include::{snippets}/ping/http-request.adoc[]

=== Response

include::{snippets}/ping/http-response.adoc[]

Notice how we get the CSRF cookie in the response, which is to be sent as a header in next requests. Read https://naturalprogrammer.gitbooks.io/spring-lemon-getting-started/content/api_documentation.html#csrf[this] for more details.

=== Business rules

. Should return a 200 OK with a cookie named "XSRF-TOKEN"

=== Positive test cases

. Should return a 200 OK with a cookie named "XSRF-TOKEN"

== Get context

Gets useful application properties and current user data.

TIP: Call this to fetch useful application properties and current-user data when an AngularJS application starts.

=== Request

include::{snippets}/context/http-request.adoc[]

=== Response

include::{snippets}/context/http-response.adoc[]

*Fields*

include::{snippets}/context/response-fields.adoc[]

_user_ would be omitted if nobody is logged in.

Refer the book https://gum.co/exuo/associate[Spring Framework REST API Development - A Complete Blueprint] to know how to customize this response and other details.

=== Business rules

The _current-user_ data, _reCaptchaSiteKey_, and the _lemon.shared.*_ properties should be there in the response. Current-user data shouldn't include any confidential fields.

=== Positive test cases

. When not logged in, _reCaptchaSiteKey_, _lemon.shared.*_ properties should be there in the response. Current user data should be absent.
. When logged in, _reCaptchaSiteKey_, _lemon.shared.*_ properties should be there in the response. Current user data should look as above, with confidential fields omitted..

== Login

Logs the user in. To remember the user for 15 days, send a _rememberMe_ parameter set as `true`.

=== Request

include::{snippets}/login/http-request.adoc[]

*Parameters*

include::{snippets}/login/request-parameters.adoc[]

=== Response

include::{snippets}/login/http-response.adoc[]

=== Business rules

. Upon successful login, current-user data should be returned as the response.
. Giving wrong credentials should respond with `401 Aunauthorized`.
. Spring security token based http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#remember-me[remember-me] rules apply. Importantly,
.. A `rememberMe` cookie is returned when `rememberMe=true` is passed as a request parameter.
.. Sending the remember me cookie from a different session within 15 days would log the user in.
.. Upon logout, the cookie is reset.

=== Positive test cases

. When a good ADMIN logs in, the response should contain
.. his `name`
.. a `roles` collection with role "ADMIN"
.. `goodAdmin` as true
. When `rememberMe=true` parameter is sent, a `rememberMe` cookie is received. That cookie can be used in a different session to log the user in. Upon logging out from that session, the `rememberMe` cookie is reset.

=== Negative test cases

. Giving wrong credentials should respond with `401 Aunauthorized`.
. A wrong `rememberMe` cookie should not log a user in.

== Logout

Logs a user out.

=== Request

include::{snippets}/logout/http-request.adoc[]

=== Response

include::{snippets}/logout/http-response.adoc[]

== Switch user

=== Switching to another user

== Sign up

Signs up a new user and logs him in. A <<VerificationMail>> is sent to his email.

=== Request

include::{snippets}/signup/http-request.adoc[]

*Add `captchaResponse` field if you want captcha validation*. Sign up let's you use the new https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/[reCAPTCHA] from Google. If you use it, `captchaResponse` field should hold the captcha response. To use it,

. At the server side, set a couple of properties, as described https://naturalprogrammer.gitbooks.io/spring-lemon-getting-started/content/configuring/setting-up-application-properties.html[here].
. At the client side, for an AngularJS client, https://github.com/VividCortex/angular-recaptcha[angular-recaptcha] works great. Remember to send the captcha response in the `captchaResponse` field.

If you don't want Captcha, e.g. in a demo app, just don't provide the captcha related properties in _application.yml_.

=== Response

include::{snippets}/signup/http-response.adoc[]

=== Business rules

. Nobody should have already logged in.
. Email, password and name should be https://naturalprogrammer.gitbooks.io/spring-lemon-getting-started/content/common/user_constraints.html[valid].
. The role UNVERIFIED is added to the user upon sign up.
. Password is stored encoded.
. After successful sign up
.. The user is signed in.
.. A verification mail is sent to the given email id.

=== Positive test cases

. A user should be able to sign up.
. After signing up
.. The user should have signed in.
.. His role should be UNVERIFIED.
.. A verification mail should have been sent to the user.

=== Negative test cases

Sign up will respond with errors if you try it

. After being already logged in.
. With https://naturalprogrammer.gitbooks.io/spring-lemon-getting-started/content/common/user_constraints.html[invalid] email, password or name.
. Using an email id which is already signed up.
. With invalid captcha.

== Resend verification mail

A verification mail is sent to users upon sign up. But, sometimes they may miss it. So, when a unverified user signs in, you may like to show him a button or something to resend the verification mail. Clicking on that should send a request to your API as below.

=== Request

include::{snippets}/resend-verification-mail/http-request.adoc[]

=== Response

include::{snippets}/resend-verification-mail/http-response.adoc[]

=== Business rules

. The user should exist.
. Current-user should have https://naturalprogrammer.gitbooks.io/spring-lemon-getting-started/content/common/accessing_users.html[permission to edit] the given user.
. The user should not have been verified.
. A new verification code isn't generated. The existing verification code is used instead. It's because sometimes the user might find the old mail, and try verifying with that.

=== Test cases

*Positive*

. An unverified user should be able to resend his verification code. The verificationCode of the user should not change in the process.
. A good ADMIN should be able to resend the verification mail of another unverified user.

*Negative*

. Providing unknown user id
. Trying
.. without logging in
.. logging in as a different user
.. logging in as a bad ADMIN
.. while already verified
